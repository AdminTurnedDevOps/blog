# How to submit a blog post 

Internal authors can create a branch for their work, external authors need to fork the repo.

Posts are organized in year-month directories (i.e., 2020-01/), find or create the directory that is roughly when your post is going out and add your files there. 

When you're happy with your post and think it's ready to be reviewed, create a PR and assign @robpearson and @wordlee as reviewers.

If you're drafting a post that you'd like to keep private until it's published, use the [internal blog drafts repo](https://github.com/OctopusDeploy/internal-blog-drafts).
