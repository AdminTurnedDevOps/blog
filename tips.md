# Writing Tips

The Octopus Blog is one of the ways we talk to our customers and help future customers discover Octopus. We do this by publishing posts that resonate with our users (and potential users) on topics of interest to them that intersect with the problems Octopus solves.

This page provides some tips for writing for the Octopus blog. Nothing on this page is absolute, it's not a style guide, but hopefully it's a useful starting point that will help you get started.

## What to write

We have five main categories that we blog about:

- **Company**: Announcements about changes at Octopus.
- **Product**: Posts detailing new releases, features, roadmap, RFCs, etc.
- **Engineering**: Developer tools, programming, performance, and behind the scenes technical posts.
- **CI/CD and DevOps**: CI/CD, DevOps, and operations related posts.
- **Events and Webinars**: Information about events we're attending and webinars we're running.

## Voice

Writing is hard, and we all have different voices, but we want the experience of reading the blog to be consistent and useful. All of the posts are edited before they're published, but the following principles are designed to help guide the voice we use (and hopefully reduce the number of edits):

1. We're direct and honest, and we don't use hyperbole or marketing-speak.

    Our users are educated professionals, they prefer directness and honesty so they can decide for themselves if something is useful or interesting to them. They're suspicious of marketing-speak, and we don't use hyperbole or try to hoodwink people into reading on. This applies throughout every post, but by including a brief statement upfront about the topic of the post you allow readers to self select.

1. The posts we write have well defined topics.

    After reading one of our posts, we want our readers to feel like learned something. Our posts help users solve a problem, tell a story, or otherwise inform them.
    
1. We're clear and concise.

    Often the topics we write about are complicated and the potential for confusion is high, because of this we opt for simple sentence structures, and we get to the point. This can be difficult in a first draft so it's often a good idea to get the first draft down as quickly as possible, then when you know what you want to say, revise the copy. See below for [self-editing tips](#self-editing-tips).
   
1. We're not Octo-obsessed.

    Octopus isn't the only thing we blog about. We love Octopus, and we hope our users do too, but Octopus isn't the only tool that can solve our users problems and sometimes, it isn't the right tool, but that shouldn't stop us sharing useful content with our users.

1. We have confidence in the strength of our topics.

    The posts we write are interesting in their own right and don't rely on gimmicks, too much humor (jokes, gifs, links to videos), or asides to carry the posts. We're not trying to impress anybody without wit or pop-culture knowledge. Well thought-out, well written posts that have something interesting to say 
 
 
## Self-editing tips

Whitespace is your friend
revise complicated structures. 
Think about the order information is being presented in both at the level of the entire post and at the sentence level.
Remove parenthetical clauses
Use grammarly but don't take it's word on everything.
Use text to speech to listen to your words. Our brains are super smart and kinda lazy at the same time, when you're reading your own work your smart-lazy brain skips ahead because it remembers what your wrote, what it actually remembers is what you think you wrote. This is why typos persist even after multiple re-reads. Text-to-speech solves this by reading what you actually wrote.
Remove sticky words. Sticky words are those words that don't convey any meaning other than connecting the content words. 
> It is possible to be able to... 

Or: 
> You can 

Just say it. 
Review the edits, if you disagree with the edits or just want to understand them, ask :)
Casual voice.
