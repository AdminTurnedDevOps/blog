# Writing Tips

The Octopus Blog is one of the ways we talk to our customers and help future customers discover Octopus. We do this by publishing posts that resonate with our users (and potential users) on topics of interest to them that intersect with the problems Octopus solves.

This page provides some tips for writing for the Octopus blog. Nothing on this page is absolute, it's not a style guide and it will continue to grow over time.

## What to write

We have five main categories that we blog about:

- **Company**: Announcements about changes at Octopus.
- **Product**: Posts detailing new releases, features, the roadmap, RFCs, etc.
- **Engineering**: Posts about developer tools, programming, performance, and behind the scenes technical posts.
- **CI/CD and DevOps**: CI/CD, DevOps, and operations related posts.
- **Events and Webinars**: Information about events we're attending and webinars we're running.

## Principles

Writing is hard, and we all have different voices, but we want the experience of reading the blog to be consistent and useful. All of the posts are edited before they're published, but the following principles are designed to help guide the voice we use:

1. The posts we write are useful and informative to our target audience and demonstrate our domain expertise.

2. We're direct and honest, and we don't use hyperbole or marketing-speak.

    Our users are educated professionals, they prefer directness and honesty so they can decide for themselves if something is useful or interesting. They're (rightly) suspicious of anything that sounds like marketing-speak, and they want to know the details. We don't use hyperbole or try to hoodwink people into reading on. This applies throughout every post, but clearly explaining the topic in the opening sentences lets readers decide if they care enough to read on. Even if one topic doesn't appeal to them, by not wasting their time, they're more likely to read on the next time they see a post from us that does appeal, however, if we did waste their time, it's unlikely they'd return at all.
    
3. The posts we write have well defined topics.

    After reading one of our posts, we want our readers to feel like they learned something useful. Our posts help readers solve specific problems, tell a story, or otherwise inform them. The better you define your topic and the problem you want to solve before you start writing, the better the chances are your post will be useful, direct, and informative. Having a well defined topic helps keep us on a direct path from Problem to Solution without wandering off into side stories or anecdotes that don't directly support the solution being presented.
    
4. We're clear and concise.

    We remove the obstacles between the reader and our meaning. This meaning editing out unnecessary sentences, clauses, and words that don't directly convey meaning. Often the topics we write about are complicated and the potential for confusion is high, because of this we opt for simple sentence structures that don't place additional cognitive load on the reader.
    
    For instance, the first sentence in this section originally read:

> We try to remove as many of the obstacles between the reader and their understanding as we can.
    
    I revised it to:
    
> We remove the obstacles between the reader and our meaning.
    
    There are less words to process and trip over in the second version.

    Being clear and concise in a first draft is difficult, so sometimes it's best to get the first draft down, and then go back through the text and delete anything that can be deleted. A simple rule here is:
     
> If something can be deleted without altering the meaning or tone of the text, it probably should be deleted.
    
5. We're writing for an international audience.
    
    Our customers are everywhere. Some of them are native English speakers, but many of them are not. We avoid colloquialisms that would likely confuse them, and we use US English.
   
6. We're not Octo-obsessed.

    Octopus isn't the only thing we blog about. We love Octopus, and we hope our users do too, but Octopus isn't the only tool that can solve our users problems and sometimes, it's not even the right tool, but that shouldn't stop us sharing useful content with our users.
