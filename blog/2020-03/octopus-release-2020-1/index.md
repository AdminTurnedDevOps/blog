* [Worker pools can now scoped to environments or tenant tags](blog/2020-03/octopus-release-2020-1/index.md#worker-pools-can-be-scoped-by-environment-or-tenants) - New worker pool variables unlock the ability to have dedicated worker pools for different environments or tenant tags.

This is the [first release of six in 2020](/blog/2020-03/releases-and-lts/index.md) and we're excited to share it with the world. Keep reading to learn more about the updates. 

## Dark Mode

Developers and operations folks love dark mode and I'm thrilled to share that Octopus now supports dark mode. It's a cool feature but it also easier on eyes, helps reduce eye strain and looks amazing. ðŸ˜Ž

Octopus includes support to detect if your OS is running dark mode and can switch automatically. I highly recommend turning it on and giving it a test drive.

## Octopus and Octopus CLI are now more at home on Linux and macOS

Octopus aims to have world-class support for multiple platforms including Windows machines, Linux machines and popular cloud services. This release includes two changes to make Octopus feel more at home on Linux and macOS.

### Octopus CLI available via HomeBrew, APT and YUM 

![](octopus-cli-xplat.png)

The Octopus CLI, formerly known as `octo.exe`, is a handy and powerful tool that enables teams to interact with Octopus from the command line. It's now available to install quickly and easily via the following platforms and package repostitories. 

* Chocolatey
* HomeBrew 
* APT
* YUM 

The new additions are HomeBrew, APT and YUM so teams using macOS and Linux can take advantage of this in an easier way.

### Azure and AWS deployments work on Windows and Linux machines

Octopus includes numerous popular step templates to deploy to Azure and AWS cloud infrastructure. These steps can now be executed on Windows and Linux deployment targets or workers 

One final note. 

Seamless Kubernetes authentication with Azure and AWS Accounts

* [Azure deployments](https://octopus.com/docs/deployment-examples/azure-deployments)
* [AWS deployments](https://octopus.com/docs/deployment-examples/aws-deployments)
* [Kubernetes](https://)

Our Kubernetes deployment step templates now support Azure and AWS accounts. It is now possible to take advantage of your AWS and Azure accounts created in our infrastructure area

## Worker Pools can be scoped by environment or tenants

TODO: Screenshot

Workers enable teams to move deployment work onto other machines running in pools. You can create a pool of dedicated workers that can be utilized for specific deployment work by multiple projects and teams. Common examples are database deployments or deployments to cloud services.

In Octopus 2020.1, we have added support for worker pool variables unlocking the ability to scope worker pools by environment or tenants. For example, you could have a database deployment worker pool dedicated to deployments to your dev and test environments and a larger pool dedicated to deployments to production. 

This was a popular customer request and we're please to ship this update.
