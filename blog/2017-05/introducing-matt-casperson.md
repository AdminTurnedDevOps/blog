Hi. I've just started at Octopus Deploy as a Software Engineer in May 2017. In my previous life I have had a long
line of Java development roles, starting in Red Hat in 2010. I've published books on 
[3D web development](http://www.packtpub.com/away3d-36-essentials/book) and released some 
open source projects for [end to end testing of web applications](https://autogeneral.gitbooks.io/iridiumapplicationtesting-gettingstartedguide/content/).

On the weekends you'll find me motorbiking around the hills with friends, or catching up on some .NET study.

You can find me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/mattcasperson/), [Twitter](https://twitter.com/mcasperson)
and [DZone](https://dzone.com/users/343648/mcasperson.html).
