Have you outgrown your current CI/CD pipeline? Is it to slow, manual or requires tweaking too many settings too often? Have you accidentally become the person in charge of “DevOps”?

Fear no more, in this hands-on workshop, Derek will walk you through CI/CD core concepts and best practices, as well as review real-world release management and automation problems and how to overcome them.

During this half-day workshop on September 23rd, 2019, you will get hands-on access to “Insert Build Technology” & Octopus Cloud with a sample application. You will configure its build, run automated tests, design your deployment process, and finally promote it through Dev, Test, and Production environments.

Requirements

* Laptop
* VS Code or Visual Studio 2017+
* Modern Web browser

At Octopus Deploy, we are passionate about automation, be it code, databases, or infrastructure.  Which is why we are excited to announce that [Derek Campbell](https://twitter.com/octoderek) will continue this discussion in our presentation on "Turbocharging Azure DevOps with Octopus Deploy" at the [WinOp's London Event](https://www.winops.org/london/) on the 24th of September 2019.

In this session, Derek will take you through how to integrate Azure DevOps and Octopus Deploy using the Azure DevOps extension. He will then demo an Azure pipeline and lastly pass this through to Octopus Deploy which will then deploy to Azure from a single build and test all the way to Production.
