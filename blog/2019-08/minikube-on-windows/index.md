## Create an external switch

Minikube requires an external HyperV switch to operate, and you may find that you donâ€™t have one by default.

To view the list of switches, open the `HyperV Manager` and select `Virtual Switch Manager...` from the list of actions.

*The HyperV actions menu.*

In the screenshot below you can see that there are no existing external switches, so we need to create one by selecting the `External` option and clicking the `Create Virtual Switch` button. Click the `OK` button to create the switch.

Connect the virtual switch to the PCs local network adapter (in this example, the wireless network adapter).

You will receive a warning that the network connection will de disrupted. Click `Yes` to continue.

## Install kubectl

The command line tool used to interact with Kubernetes is called `kubectl`. This can be installed 2 ways:

* With [Chocolatey](https://chocolatey.org/packages/kubernetes-cli) using the command `choco install kubernetes-cli`.
* Manually downloaded from [https://storage.googleapis.com/kubernetes-release/release/v1.15.0/bin/windows/amd64/kubectl.exe](https://storage.googleapis.com/kubernetes-release/release/v1.15.0/bin/windows/amd64/kubectl.exe). Note that the version of the latest download can be found at [https://storage.googleapis.com/kubernetes-release/release/stable.txt](https://storage.googleapis.com/kubernetes-release/release/stable.txt). Simply replace the `v1.15.0` in the first URL with the version returned by the second URL.

## Install Minikube

You can install Minikube 2 ways:

* With [Chocolatey](https://chocolatey.org/packages/Minikube) using the command `choco install minikube`.
* Downloading and installing the executable from [GitHub](https://github.com/kubernetes/minikube/releases/latest/download/minikube-installer.exe).

With Minikube installed, open up a Powershell terminal as an Administrator.

![](run-as-administrator.png "width=500")
*Launching the terminal as administrator.*

Minikube can then be started with the command:

```PowerShell
minikube start `
--vm-driver hyperv `
--hyperv-virtual-switch "External Switch"
```

A new virtual machine called `minikube` will be created.

Once the installation has completed, we can interact with the Minikube cluster via `kubectl`.

![](minikube-start.png "width=500")
*The minikube clutser has been started successfully.*

## Running some commands

The minikube installation will update the file at `~/.kube/config` with the details of the test cluster:

```PowerShell
PS C:\Users\Matthew> cat ~/.kube/config
apiVersion: v1
clusters:
- cluster:
    certificate-authority: C:\Users\Matthew\.minikube\ca.crt
    server: https://10.1.1.122:8443
  name: minikube
contexts:
- context:
    cluster: minikube
    user: minikube
  name: minikube
current-context: minikube
kind: Config
preferences: {}
users:
- name: minikube
  user:
    client-certificate: C:\Users\Matthew\.minikube\client.crt
    client-key: C:\Users\Matthew\.minikube\client.key
```

We can test that the installation is working by listing the nodes:

```PowerShell
PS C:\Users\Matthew> kubectl get nodes
NAME       STATUS   ROLES    AGE     VERSION
minikube   Ready    master   6m47s   v1.15.2
```

## Connecting Octopus to Minikube

To use Minikube from Octopus, we need to upload the client certificate. Minikube splits the certificate and key into two files, so we use [OpenSSL](https://slproweb.com/products/Win32OpenSSL.html) to merge them into a single PFX file.

```PowerShell
& "C:\Program Files\OpenSSL-Win64\bin\openssl.exe" pkcs12 `
  -passout pass: `
  -export `
  -out certificateandkey.pfx `
  -in C:\Users\Matthew\.minikube\client.crt `
  -inkey C:\Users\Matthew\.minikube\client.key
```

The resulting file `certificateandkey.pfx` can then be uploaded to Octopus.

![](certificate.png "width=500")
*The certificate and key that was created by minikube and combined by OpenSSL.*

To allow Octopus to communicate with the local virtual machine, we need to create a worker instance on our local PC.

![](worker.png "width=500")
*A polling worker tentacle running on the same mahcine as the minikube cluster.*

We can now create a Kubernetes target pointing to the local URL of the Minikube cluster, which can be found from this line in the `~/.kube/config` file:

```YAML
server: https://10.1.1.122:8443
```

The Kubernetes target will use the certificate we uploaded eralier for authentication, and skip TLS verification for convenience.

::hint
You could upload the certificate reference by the `certificate-authority` property in the `~/.kube/config` file and set that as the server certificate if you wanted to.

*A Kubernetes target, configured to use the local worker tentacle, talking to the internal minikube IP address.*

With the target defined, we can use the [Octopus Script Console](https://octopus.com/docs/administration/managing-infrastructure/script-console) to interact with it.

![](script-console.png "width=500")
*The script console is a handy way to run ad-hoc scripts.*

The command will be executed via the worker tentacle to interact with the local minikube cluster.
