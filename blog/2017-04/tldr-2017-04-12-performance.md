description: Once a week we have a short "TL;DR" meeting where team members present things that are interesting. We're going to start recording and posting portions of them to YouTube each week. This first one was about some performance improvements.

Every Wednesday morning we have a short company-wide meeting, which we call the "TL;DR". It's an open invitation for any team member to present anything that they think is relevant or interesting, and that they want the rest of the company to know about. They cover a variety of topics, from feature design, to lessons learned as a result of support incidents, to patterns developers might want to use when building the software. 

As an experiment, we're going to take these presentations and make them public each week - at least the bits that aren't too confidential ;-) I hope it will give you a bit of a "behind the scenes" look at what it's like inside of Octopus. 

Today's TL;DR featured two presentations that were about performance. Octopus 3.12 featured some pretty dramatic performance improvements, thanks to some customers who reported issues and were able to provide traces and other information to help us reproduce the problems. 

First, Rob Erez shares some upcoming [improvements related to browser caching and reducing our overall number of web requests](https://github.com/OctopusDeploy/Issues/issues/3389). Then, Michael Noonan shares the process he followed recently to [diagnose some memory issues](https://github.com/OctopusDeploy/Issues/issues/3398) using [JetBrains dotMemory](https://www.jetbrains.com/dotmemory/). I hope you enjoy!
