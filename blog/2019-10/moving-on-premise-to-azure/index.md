## The Problem

Working as part of the Customer Success teams means we work with a range of customers from the smallest teams using Octopus in a single space to working with Global companies with diverse, distributed technical teams who want to work with Octopus to deploy Infrastructure, Databases and their packaged applications. In today's cloud-native world we see a lot of customers who want to move their Octopus workload from On-Premise data centres to Azure, and with our recent license changes which allows all new licenses the ability to be highly available, often the choice is to host Octopus in Azure. In this blog, we will cover how to move your existing Octopus instance to a highly available configuration in an Azure region.

### Existing Infrastructure

Most organizations using Octopus, are still running it in a single node configuration on a Virtual Machine hosted on a hypervisor with local storage. It's normally hosted on a dedicated Virtual Machine listening over HTTP or HTTPS using a [LetsEncrypt](https://letsencrypt.org/) SSL certificate or a SSL certificate generated by a [Certificate Authority](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Certificate_authority) much like [GoDaddy](godaddy.com).

Unfortunately, [LetsEncrypt](https://letsencrypt.org/) SSL certificates are not supported automatically in a Highly-Available configuration, so if you are planning moving it to Azure, then you may need one from a [Certificate Authority](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Certificate_authority).

If you're hosting on-Premise, you will likely have Octopus Confgured on the C or D Drive, under C:\Octopus or D:\Octopus with Logs, Artifacts, Packages and Task Logs hosted under folders locally or on a Network Attached Storage device. 

### Proof of Concept vs Production move

Generally, when doing something for the first time, we recommend running a Proof of Concept before trying it on your production instance of Octopus. You will need to decide whether you are doing this as a Prood of Concept or in Production ahead of time.

There would be nothing wrong with lifting and shifting your existing Production instance and moving it to the cloud and get this working before then making it highly-available by adding in a second node, and a load balancer as long as you have already configured shared storage for 

## Prep work

There is going to be some preparation required

## Azure Architecture

### Virtual Machines

### Shared storage

Octopus stores a number of files that are not suitable to store in the database. These include:

- NuGet packages used by the [built-in NuGet repository](https://octopus.com/docs/packaging-applications/package-repositories) inside Octopus. These packages can often be very large.
- Artifacts collected during a deployment. Teams using Octopus sometimes use this feature to collect large log files and other files from machines during a deployment.
- Task logs, which are text files that store all of the log output from deployments and other tasks.

As with the database, from the Octopus perspective, you'll simply tell the Octopus Servers where to store them as a file path within your operating system. Octopus doesn't really care what technology you use to present the shared storage, it could be a mapped network drive, or a UNC path to a file share. Each of these three types of data can be stored in a different place.

Whichever way you provide the shared storage, a few considerations to keep in mind:

- To Octopus, it needs to appear as a mapped network drive (e.g., D:\) or a UNC path to a file share (e.g., \\server\path)
- The service account that Octopus runs as needs full control over the directory
- Drives are mapped per-user, so you should map the drive using the same service account that Octopus is running under

#### Azure Files

If your Octopus Server is running in Microsoft Azure, there is really only one solution unless you have a [DFS Replica](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/storage/dfs-replication/dfsr-overview) in Azure, and that solution is [Azure File Storage](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/storage/files/storage-files-introduction) - it just presents a file share over SMB 3.0 that can be shared across all of your Octopus servers. 

Once you have created your File Share you can mount the drive for use by Octopus. Remember, drives are mounted per user. Make sure to map a persistent network drive for the user account the Octopus Server is running under.

Run the below before installing Octopus.

````powershell
# Add the Authentication for the symbolic links. You can get this from the Azure Portal

cmdkey /add:octostorage.file.core.windows.net /user:Azure\octostorage /pass:XXXXXXXXXXXXXX

# Add Octopus folder to add symbolic links

New-Item -ItemType directory -Path C:\Octopus
New-Item -ItemType directory -Path C:\Octopus\Artifacts
New-Item -ItemType directory -Path C:\Octopus\Packages
New-Item -ItemType directory -Path C:\Octopus\TaskLogs

# Add the Symbolic Links. Do this before installing Octopus

mklink /D C:\Octopus\TaskLogs \\octostorage.file.core.windows.net\octoha\TaskLogs
mklink /D C:\Octopus\Artifacts \\octostorage.file.core.windows.net\octoha\Artifacts
mklink /D C:\Octopus\Packages \\octostorage.file.core.windows.net\octoha\Packages
````

Install Octopus and then run the below.

````powershell

# Set the path
& 'C:\Program Files\Octopus Deploy\Octopus\Octopus.Server.exe' path --artifacts "C:\Octopus\Artifacts"
& 'C:\Program Files\Octopus Deploy\Octopus\Octopus.Server.exe' path --taskLogs "C:\Octopus\TaskLogs"
& 'C:\Program Files\Octopus Deploy\Octopus\Octopus.Server.exe' path --nugetRepository "C:\Octopus\Packages"
````

### Load Balancer

This one took me a bit of time to make a selection as there are a few options for balancing your loads in Azure. It will depend entirely on your preference and what your Network team have a preference for as there are so many option, and we are only listing a few of these below. 

* [Azure Traffic Manager](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/traffic-manager/traffic-manager-overview)
* [Azure Application Gateway](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/application-gateway/overview)
* [Azure Load Balancer](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/load-balancer/load-balancer-overview)
* [Kemp LoadMaster](https://kemptechnologies.com/uk/solutions/microsoft-load-balancing/loadmaster-azure/)
* [F5 Big-IP Virtual Edition](https://www.f5.com/partners/technology-alliances/microsoft-azure)
