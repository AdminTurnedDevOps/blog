As described in the first blog post of this series https://octopus.com/blog/octopus-cloud-1.0-reflections, the cost of Octopus Cloud v1 wasn't vailable long term. We had to reduce the cost substantially and this blog 
post describes the final solution (Octopus Cloud v2) and how we arrived at it.

## Body

When we embarked on the journey to lower the cost of Octopus Cloud v1, we started looking first for incremental improvements. Each Cloud Instance need 3 resources to run: compute, file storage and database storage. Octopus is not 
constantly running code so we were looking for solutions that allow us to pool resources. 


we decided to started with a brainstorming session where no idea, no matter how crazy, was off the table.
