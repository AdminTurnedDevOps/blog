Hi, I'm the newest (and third) Michael to join Octopus.

I've done a pretty diverse range of things.  I've spent time as a developer for 3D virtual reality software as well as writing code for research at CSIRO.  I squeezed in a Ph.D. in at one point, and I've taught budding young programmers.  Most recently I've been working at a graph database start-up.

Now, I'm keen to find out how much .NET and C# I can squeeze into my head and deploy back out again.

When not at the keyboard, I'm likely to be found outside.  I like running, sports that involve running and also running around - walking is a bit like slow running, so it's alright too.  My kids ensure that I get lots of running, and my sheep and chickens also encourage me out often enough.
