Hey friend! I'm Andrew K, the second Andrew to join the Octopus crew - nice to meet you.

In 2012 I founded my own company, and have spent the last 5 years building and supporting data analysis software in South Australian schools. It's been a long and windy road, but it's time for [Scorelink](http://www.scorelink.com.au) to spread its wings and fly on its own, like a beautiful bird.

With the shift away from Scorelink I've decided to trade analytics for tentacles and join the fine folks at Octopus. I've a musical background, so the language of C# calls to me in more ways than one. 

When I'm not at my desk pecking away at the keyboard I'm probably found in the garden trying to grow vegetables, ferns or hops for home-brew. Either that, or trying to program a smart watering controller to automate all the fun out of my life.
