## First-class Java deployments

3.17 introduces a number of new steps for deploying and managing applications against Java application servers, as well as providing support for managing `jar`, `war`, `ear` and `rar` files in the built-in Octopus library.

![Java Steps](java-steps.png)

These new steps allow Java applications to be deployed to WildFly 10+ and Red Hat JBoss EAP 6+ application servers, as well as Tomcat 7+. In addition, the `Deploy Java Archive` step allows Java applications to be copied to a custom location on the target machine, allowing Java applications to be deployed in any Java application server capable of using file copy deployments.

See the [documentation](http://g.octopushq.com/JavaAppDeploy) for more information on these new steps.
