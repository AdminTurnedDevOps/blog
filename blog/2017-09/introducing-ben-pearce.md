Hi, my name is Ben and I started as a developer at Octopus in August 2017.

In my previous work, I spent many years as a developer at [Sunsuper](https://www.sunsuper.com.au/), and was fortunate to have worked across many areas and technologies, and not so fortunate to also work with VB6 and BizTalk!  I was also lucky enough to experience a wide variety of build and deployment scenarios, from manual 2 hour long build processes to automated TeamCity build and deployments and all the fun that large enterprises bring along with them.  For me, Octopus represents the next logical step in evolving these processes and I am happy to be able to contribute to Octopus Deploy's success as well as our customers.
