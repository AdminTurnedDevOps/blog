Hi! I'm Jayden and I joined Octopus in December 2017.

I've been working in the .NET space since 2009, beginning with WPF desktop apps and moving onto ASP.NET MVC, then Web API backends and SPA frontends.  Most of my time has been spent building online ordering systems in the fast food industry.

I've walked the journey from hand-built production releases to full continuous integration and continuous delivery, and I love how well Octopus fits into that space and makes my life easier.

In my spare time you'll likely still find me at the computer playing a game or two, and I also enjoy flying quadcopters, building something in the shed, or writing software to monitor my home's energy usage.
