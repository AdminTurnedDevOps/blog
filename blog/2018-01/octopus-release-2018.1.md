This January release of Octopus Deploy is primarily a security release driven by [Octopus Cloud](https://octopus.com/cloud) and will also benefit each of our customers running Octopus Deploy on-premises. We highly recommend upgrading.

You'll also notice our new versioning strategy: what would normally have been Octopus `4.2` is actually `2018.1`. Read more about [why we changed](version-change-2018.md).

## Octopus Cloud alpha

One of our big drivers for this year is to bring our hosted Octopus offering to market, called **[Octopus Cloud](https://octopus.com/cloud)**. If you are interested in being part of our closed alpha program, you can [register your interest today](https://octopus.com/cloud)! The closed alpha will kick off very soon, followed by an open beta, the official launch, and later in the year we will be launching our Data Centre edition.

## Security enhancements

In preparation for [Octopus Cloud](https://octopus.com/cloud) we've performed penetration testing and a security audit. No major issues were found but uncovered a few smaller issues we wanted to fix. You may have seen several security fixes in recent patches. This feature release rolls up all of those patches, along with some extra enhancements you can use to make your Octopus Server more secure than ever.

### New built-in roles and permissions

Octopus ships with several built-in [teams and user roles](https://octopus.com/docs/administration/managing-users-and-teams), one of which is the `Octopus Administrators` team with the `System Administrator` role granting the rights to do anything and everything in your Octopus installation.

In Octopus `2018.1` we have effectively split the `Octopus Administrators` team and its `System Administrator` user role into two parts:

- We've kept the existing `Octopus Administrators` team and `System Administrator` role which is all about configuring the Octopus Server and how it is hosted
- We've added a new `Octopus Managers` team and `System Manager` role which is all about configuring your users, teams, projects, environments, etc

This makes a lot of sense for [Octopus Cloud](https://octopus.com/cloud):

- Our team needs to configure how your Octopus Server is hosted, but shouldn't be able to see anything else - we'll be members of the `Octopus Administrators` team.
- We don't want you to inadvertently break your Octopus Server by changing its hosting configuration - you'll be added to the `Octopus Managers` team.

This new division makes sense for larger installations of Octopus, where you want to have a clearer distinction between teams and their responsibilities.

#### New permissions

The underpinning of these changes are a series of new permissions which you may use in your own Octopus installation:

- `UserEdit` was added to fill a gap in our existing permission structure for editing users directly - this was previously required the `AdministerSystem` permission
- `FeatureView` and `FeatureEdit` for independent control over who can see which Octopus features are enabled and who can enable/disable features
- `ConfigurationView` and `ConfigurationEdit` controls who can change hosting-related configuration which all exist under the {{Configuration>Settings}} page
- `SmtpSettingsView` and `SmtpSettingsEdit` controls who can configure an SMTP server for sending email

#### Upgrade experience

When you upgrade your existing Octopus Server, or start a brand new installation of Octopus Server:

- the `System Administrator` user role will be automatically granted the new permissions (this is the same process we've used when adding new permissions in the past)
- the `Octopus Managers` team and `System Manager` role will be automatically created and granted the appropriate permissions

### Actively preventing escalation of privileges (CVE-2018-5706)

[CVE-2018-5706](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2018-5706)

The built-in user roles are sufficient for most common scenarios. In larger scale installations of Octopus people tend to tailor these user roles, or create their own user roles from scratch. The permissions system in Octopus is very powerful, but with great power comes additional complexity... and great responsibility. In earlier versions of Octopus, if you configured these roles incorrectly you might have accidentally granted a team the ability to escalate their own privileges.

Octopus `2018.1` has an additional layer of security which actively prevents any user from escalating their own or another user's privileges beyond the scope of their current scope of privileges.

## Step package requirement

By default, Octopus performs package acquisition immediately before the first step in a deployment that requires packages. Steps can now be configured to run before or after package acquisition.  The step condition `Run this step` has been replaced by `Package requirement`:

Previous:
![Step condition - Run this step](step_condition-run_this_step.png)

New:
![Step condition - Package requirement](step_condition-package_requirement.png)

The new `Package requirement` allows a more explicit configuration of when a step should run with respect to package acquisition. There are three options to choose from:

- `Let Octopus Decide` (default): Packages may be acquired before or after this step runs - Octopus will determine the best time
- `After package acquisition`: Packages will be acquired before this step runs
- `Before package acquisition`: Packages will be acquired after this step runs

This option is hidden when it does not make sense, for example, when a script step is configured to run after a package step (packages must be acquired by this point).

These options provide more flexibility when configuring complex parallel deployment processes to ensure that packages are acquired at the desired time. You can now configure a parallel block of steps that generate packages and use the option `Before package acquisition` to ensure that the packages can be consumed by subsequent package steps.

## Breaking Changes

We've made two behavioral changes to Octopus which may impact certain customers.

- [Steps may now be explicitly configured to run before or after package acquisition](https://github.com/OctopusDeploy/Issues/issues/3974): This change includes a database migration that is difficult to roll back from.
- [Auto machine removal timing does not take into account if Octopus Server is offline](https://github.com/OctopusDeploy/Issues/issues/3924)

## Upgrading

As usual [steps for upgrading Octopus Deploy](https://octopus.com/docs/administration/upgrading) apply. Please see the [release notes](https://octopus.com/downloads/compare?to=2018.1.0) for further information.

## Wrap up

Thatâ€™s it for this month. We hope you had a fantastic festive season and find the new features useful. Feel free leave us a comment and let us know what you think! Go forth and deploy!
