This January release of Octopus provides a number of security enhancements such as being able to run tasks on on the server as a different user. You'll also notice our new versioning strategy: what would normally have been Octopus `4.2` is actually `2018.1`.

Read more about [why we changed our versioning strategy](/blog/2018-01/version-change-2018.md).

This provides an additional level of security ensuring tasks can't do anything they aren't supposed to. In addition there are a number of changes which we are including as part of this update in preparation for [Octopus in the cloud](https://octopus.com/cloud/register-interest).
