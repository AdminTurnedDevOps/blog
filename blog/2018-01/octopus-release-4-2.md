This January release of Octopus provides a number of security enhancements such as being able to run tasks on on the server as a different user. This provides
an additional level of security ensuring tasks can't do anything they aren't supposed to. In addition there are a number of changes which we
are including as part of this update in preparation for [Octopus in the cloud](https://octopus.com/cloud/register-interest).
