It's our first ever Ask Octopus Brisbane Edition! In this episode, we cover recurring scheduled deployments, separating teams that share a project, and using channel version rules. You can find previous episodes and submit questions on our [Ask Octopus](https://hello.octopus.com/ask-octopus) page.

Here are the questions with direct links to where they start in the video:

- [Derek discusses](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xX65jNNW49U&t=54s) "Recurring scheduled deployments and their benefits"
- [Ryan answers](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xX65jNNW49U&t=6m35s) "How can two teams share a project without affecting each other's environments or variables?"
- [Bob answers](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xX65jNNW49U&t=13m51s) "When would I use channel and version restrictions in Octopus Deploy?"
