In this webinar, you’ll learn how to accelerate your software cycles, and improve code quality, simultaneously. See a complete roadmap to establish DevOps-Centered Software Engineering discipline in your company. And, learn first-hand how you and your team can move fast, build smart, and run with confidence – with release cycles measured in hours. 

Some of the highlights:
* When it comes to deployments, the database is fundamentally different. Why is that? [7:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RAl8rIj9MB8&t=7m22s)
* What is the normal status quo at clients before they have automated their database deployments? [14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RAl8rIj9MB8&t=14m12s)
* What does an automated, unattended database deployment look like? [18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RAl8rIj9MB8&t=18m25s)
* What about DACPAC, SQL Source Control and other compare-based, or state-based methods? How do those differ from migration scripts? [35:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RAl8rIj9MB8&t=35m52s)
* When a deployment fails, how do you configure a rollback? [51:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RAl8rIj9MB8&t=51m0s)
* How do I configure a zero-downtime deployment when the database and application components both need to change? [57:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RAl8rIj9MB8&t=57m51s)
* Can you show us what the developer experience is like with a properly designed database DevOps pipeline? [1:00:40](https://youtu.be/RAl8rIj9MB8?t=3673)
