In this webinar, Paul Stovell from Octopus and Jeffrey Palermo from Clear Measure talk about how to achieve safe, automated and drama-free database deployments. 

Some of the highlights:
* When it comes to deployments, the database is fundamentally different. Why is that? [2:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7xqDBTRpGQ&t=2m32s)
* What is the normal status quo at clients before they have automated their database deployments? [8:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7xqDBTRpGQ&t=8m27s)
* What does an automated, unattended database deployment look like? [11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7xqDBTRpGQ&t=11m46s)
* What about DACPAC, SQL Source Control and other compare-based, or state-based methods? How do those differ from migration scripts? [24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7xqDBTRpGQ&t=24m59s)
* When a deployment fails, how do you configure a rollback? [34:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7xqDBTRpGQ&t=34m10s)
* How do I configure a zero-downtime deployment when the database and application components both need to change? [42:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7xqDBTRpGQ&t=42m02s)
* Can you show us what the developer experience is like with a properly designed database DevOps pipeline? [47:02](https://youtu.be/B7xqDBTRpGQ?t=47m02s)
