Hello there, I'm Jason and I have just joined Octopus Deploy as a Cloud Architect.

Immediately before coming to Octopus I was at Domain Group, building highly-available, highly-deployable infrastructure on the AWS public cloud. Prior to that I worked at companies such as Microsoft, Dimension Data and Fujitsu, in roles as diverse as Web Developer, Support Engineer and SharePoint Architect.

In my spare time I drink pina coladas, go for long walks on the beach and rant about tightening feedback loops in software delivery teams. Oh, and I ride bikes, both on and off-road.

What most excites me about arriving at Octopus is the [planned launch of Octopus as a service](https://octopus.com/blog/roadmap-2017), which will make high-quality deployment automation even more accessible.
