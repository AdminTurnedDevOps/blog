I recently hit my two year anniversary at Octopus Deploy, my octo-versary, and I thought it would interesting to share what has changed in the last year since I wrote about [my experience](https://octopus.com/blog/first-year-working-at-octopus).  

## Trust and contributing your best!

Octopus is all about trust. I mentioend this a year ago and it's worth reiterating.  We work remotely and we've added more and more people that are spread around Australia.  This means that trust is key.  No one tells me what to work on.  No one is standing behind me watching make sure I'm working from 9-5.
