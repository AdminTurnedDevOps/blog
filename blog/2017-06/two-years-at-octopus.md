I recently hit my two year octo-versary at Octopus Deploy and I thought it would interesting to share what has changed in the last year since I wrote about [my experience](https://octopus.com/blog/first-year-working-at-octopus).  

## Laptop program

An immediate benefit of rolling over the two year mark is that I'm elligable to order a new laptop under the [Octopus laptop program](https://octopus.com/blog/growing-octopus/laptop-program).  This is an awesome benefit as it gives everyone in the team access to modern hardware to do our best work.  Personally, I picked a new Apple MacBook Pro after researching all the options.  Other laptops that are popular within the team include  the Dell XPS 15, Microsoft Surfacebook and Metabox high-end machines.  

## Growth and opportunity

The Octopus team is now at 27 people strong and we're adding more soon.  I'm the 10th face on our team page [team page](https://octopus.com/team) and it's becoming more and more diverse.  When I joined Octopus, we only had engineers and our support team.  Now we have more engineers, an emerging infrastructure team, a bigger and better support team, a super talended designer, friendly sales admin and a great digital marketing manager.  Octopus is a small, focused company working to build a first class product.  Each new member of the team brings their own talents and we've adapted to working as a larger group.  

Paul blogged about our the Octopus Deploy 2017 plan for 2017 and there is a ton of things to do.  To achieve that, we're really growing and adding more people to contribute to all the roles above Since we hired Jess our designer, the polish on everything from the Octopus portal to our blog posts has sky-rocketted.  

Since then ... 

- Shipped lots of new features.  More teams.  More options.  More opportunity.
- Joined a team that interested me.
- Opportunity - Pitch new ideas.  Develop them.  Form a team.  Ship and support.

## Trust and contributing your best!

Octopus is all about trust. I mentioned this a year ago and it's worth reiterating.  We work remotely and we've added more and more people that are spread around Australia.  This means that trust is key.  No one tells me what to work on.  No one is standing behind me watching make sure I'm working from 9-5.  

Octopus has a vision for the future, quarterlly goals and plans and we all work together to achieve them.  

- Trust and shipping
- Shipping
- Finding what your good at within the team and how you can best contribute.  Then doing that.  Exploring areas you'd like to improve. 

## Working remote

I've been working remote full-time for two years and I :heart: it.  

Work-life balance is possible.  Honestly, I don't know if I could go back to a normal 9-5 type job w/ a commute into the city centre.  I get two hours of my day 

Octopus is shifting to a full remote-first approach but we still have an opportunity to meet up with other coworkers living in the same city.
