Hello! I'm Ryan and I joined Octopus as a Solution Architect in April 2018.

The majority of my experience has been in .NET web development spanning everything from Web Forms to Web API. In a past life, I used Octopus Deploy to deploy IIS sites, database migrations, Windows services, and VB6 DLLs to COM+. I have also spoken about Octopus Deploy at a number of user groups and conferences. I'm looking forward to helping new and existing customers figure out how Octopus Deploy can make their deployments better.

When not at work, I might be working on a side project, watching and performing comedy around Dallas, or giving a new hobby a go.
