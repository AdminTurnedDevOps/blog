Hi! My name is Bob Walker and I have just joined Octopus as a Solution Architect.  I have been using and (sometimes) abusing Octopus Deploy at previous employers for over three years.  During that time, I helped set up Octopus Deploy to deploy websites to IIS, windows services, SQL Server databases, and desktop applications.  One of my primary responsibilities will be helping customers set up Octopus Deploy.

I am a developer by trade, when I started .NET 1.1 just came out and ASP .NET Webforms roamed the earth.  When I started, all the deployments I was involved in required a lengthy word document and a manual copy/paste of files.  It was not uncommon for a deployment to take several hours (which started at 2:30 AM).  After living through that I have become very passionate about building out a robust continuous integration / continuous delivery pipeline.  When I was first introduced to Octopus Deploy I was hooked.  It fit so well into the CI / CD pipeline, those multi-hour deployments became a thing of the past.  

In my spare time, you can find me on a bicycle around the trails in Omaha, Nebraska, behind a lens on a walkabout, or spending time with my friends and family.
