At Octopus Deploy, we are passionate about getting out and talking with customers and giving back to the community, which is why we are excited to announce that we are attending and sponsoring [Code Conf](https://www.code-conf.com/2019/code-conf/) on October 28, 2019 at the QDI - Danish Industry, H.C. Andersens Boulevard 18, Copenhagen, Denmark.

CoDe-Conf will return to Copenhagen for the 6th year, and it promises to be bigger and better than ever. CoDe-Conf 2019 will bring together everyone in the DevOps ecosystem, from executives and managers to engineers and programmers.

Continuous Delivery and DevOps are about culture and tools, so this year's CoDe-Conf will feature two tracks. One track will focus on culture and change, and the second will focus on tech and tools. There will be something for everyone, and you can see the full list of speakers [here](https://www.code-conf.com/2019/code-conf/) and comprehensive information about the event [here](https://www.code-conf.com/about/).

There is still time to register! We have a few discounted tickets to share with customers that will save you 25%. To get the discount code, please email <Advice@Octopus.com> and mention Code Conf. Donâ€™t hesitate as we only have a few discounted tickets and once they are gone, they are gone! You can register [here](https://www.code-conf.com/2019/code-conf/#tickets).
