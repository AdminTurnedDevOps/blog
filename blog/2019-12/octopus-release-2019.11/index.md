## Painless Jenkins Integration

![Octopus Jenkins Plugin](octopus-deploy-jenkins-plugin.png "width=600")

Octopus has had a Jenkins community plugin for years built and maintained by [Brian Adriance](https://github.com/badriance) and other contributors. Octopus has worked with Brian to take over the plugin and make it officially support by Octopus. We're indebted to the effort from Brian and other contributors since the project started in 2015.

Taking over the project will help keep it up-to-date and allow us to bring additional features to it in a more timely manner. This release brings the Jenkins plugin to feature parity with our other [build server plugins]() including support for build information and automating release note generation.
