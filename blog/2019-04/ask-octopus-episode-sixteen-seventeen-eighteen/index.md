We are trying a new format where we split up our sessions into separate videos to allow customers to drill down into more specific topics. In these episodes, we cover Stopping Deployments during Upgrade, Upgrading Octopus & Automatically Auditing your Projects. You can find previous episodes and submit questions on our [Ask Octopus](https://hello.octopus.com/ask-octopus) page.
