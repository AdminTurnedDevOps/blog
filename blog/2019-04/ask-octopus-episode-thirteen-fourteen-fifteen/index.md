We are trying a new format where we split up our sessions into separate videos to allow customers to drill down into more specific topics. In these episodes, we cover Blue/Green Deployments, HA Cluster configuration and Exposing links in deployment logs via Write-Highlights. You can find previous episodes and submit questions on our [Ask Octopus](https://hello.octopus.com/ask-octopus) page.

Here are the questions with direct links to the individual videos:

- [Bob discusses](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qFqoVwVzeo0) "Blue/Green Deployments"
- [Derek discusses](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1tXVA5pyuqQ) "HA cluster configuration"
- [Ryan discusses](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qi26nNujxn4) "Exposing links in deployment logs via Write-Highlights"
