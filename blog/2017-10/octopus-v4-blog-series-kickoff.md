Octopus Deploy 4.0 is nearing completion and everyone at Octopus HQ is busy testing (we call it a bug bash) and polishing it.  Octopus v4 is our biggest release in over two years and it includes literally hundreds of changes and improvements including a brand new user interface.  This isn't just a new coat of paint. We re-wrote the Octopus web portal (moving from Angular 1.4 to React+Redux), we completely revamped our environments page, redesigned our variable editor and much, much more. We're kicking off a mini blog series to highlight some of the awesome new features coming as well as give some behind-the-scenes details and insight into the decisions that shaped them.  This will include both technical and design oriented posts.  Everything involved in making the new Octopus awesome!  

There's some great posts coming so be sure to check our blog weekly.
