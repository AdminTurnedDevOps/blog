Octopus Deploy 4.0 is nearing completion and everyone at Octopus HQ is busy testing (we call it a bug bash) and polishing it.  Octopus v4 is our biggest release in over two years and it includes literally hundreds of changes and improvements including a brand new user interface.  We're kicking off a mini blog series to highlight some of the awesome new features coming as well as give some behind-the-scenes details and insight into the decisions that shaped them.  

There's some great posts coming so be sure to check our blog weekly.
