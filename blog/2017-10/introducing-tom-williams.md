Hi, I’m Tom and I have recently joined Octopus.

I have been working as a developer in the Microsoft world for just over 8 years now, I come from a background of working on large enterprise access control systems. I have also spent time building an api platform in NodeJS for industrial hydraulic crimping hardware to become “cloud” enabled.

Over the past 24 months I have also worked with my wife to build a online maternity clothing business.

When not at the computer, I can be found doing renovations on the house, wrangling my 2 year old or working on one of my thousands of side projects.
