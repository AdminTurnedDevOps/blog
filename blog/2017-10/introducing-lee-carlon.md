Hello! 

This is my first week on the Octopus team. 

I’ve joined the team as a technical writer, so it’s probably no surprise when I say I’ll be working on the Octopus documentation.

My previous role was at Red Hat.  I started there as a technical writer in 2010 and eventually managed the docs team in Brisbane, India, and the EU.  I enjoy taking complex ideas, breaking them down and figuring out the best way to share them with other people.

In my spare time, I write science-fiction and fantasy novels.
