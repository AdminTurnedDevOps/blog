## Release Tour

## Terraform Support

This release includes two new steps: Apply a Terraform template, and Destroy Terraform resources. These steps allow Terraform templates to be executed as part of an Octopus deployment project, with integrated support for variable substitution and output variable capturing. Refer to the [documentation](https://octopus.com/docs/deploying-applications/terraform-deployments) for more information on these new steps.

## GitHub Feed Types

Adding GitHub as a feed type means that you can now deploy your external resources that dont require a dedicated pre-build step. Run scripts, templates or simple applications pulled directly from your source control by using tags to denote versions. Read more in our [Git Hub Feed documentation](https://octopus.com/docs/packaging-applications/package-repositories/github-feeds) for more information on using this new feed type.

## Upgrading

As usual [steps for upgrading Octopus Deploy](https://octopus.com/docs/administration/upgrading) apply. Please see the [release notes](https://octopus.com/downloads/compare?to=2018.3.0) for further information.

## Wrap up

Thatâ€™s it for this month. Feel free leave us a comment and let us know what you think! Go forth and deploy!
