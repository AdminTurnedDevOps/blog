Octopus started with automating deployments in the Microsoft ecosystem and we long supported deployments to Microsoft Azure platform as it evolved. Buckle up as we take a trip down memory lane.

## Early Days

Octopus Deploy v1.5.0.1645 first added support deploying to Windows Azure specifically for Cloud Services. This was fantastic and and helped tons of teams start deploy to the cloud and move to repeatable and reliable deployments. Microsoft continued to introduce new services include Azure web apps Platform as a Service (PaaS). This proved very popular and one of my first Octopus automated deployments was deploying an ASP.NET Web API web service to an Azure web app using Octopus 2.6 and [this blog post](https://octopus.com/blog/deploy-aspnet-applications-to-azure-websites).

Octopus 3.0 launched in June 2015 and introduced Azure accounts and new deployment targts to deploy to Azure Cloud Services and Azure Web web apps and as well as execute Azure Powershell scripts. We pivoted shorlty after to move to use deployments steps to deploy to Originally, we laucnhed with Azure cloud service and web site deploymetn targets but we quickly pivoted into we launched first class support for Azure Web Apps (now App Services) and Our support has only grown since that time. Octopus 3.0 brought built-in support for Azure Cloud Services, Azure Websites and Azure Powershell scripts.
