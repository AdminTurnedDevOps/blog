## Upgrading

This release contains a post-install data fix that may take some time (depending on the size of your Events table), so please ensure you allow time for this to complete. If you are running the [watchdog service](https://octopus.com/docs/administration/service-watchdog), please ensure this is stopped during the upgrade.

All of the usual [steps for upgrading Octopus Deploy](https://octopus.com/docs/administration/upgrading) apply. Please see the [release notes](https://octopus.com/downloads/compare?to=3.16.0) for further information.
