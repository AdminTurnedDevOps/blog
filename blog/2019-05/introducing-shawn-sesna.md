Hi there! Iâ€™m Shawn, and I joined the Octopus family as a Continuous Delivery Architect/Technical Account Manager in May 2019.

During my career, I have been a Developer, Database Administrator, Configuration Manager, Data Team Manager, and DevOps Manager all within Washington State Government.  I became an Octopus customer in 2015, driving its adoption over a custom solution that I wrote.  During that time I was able to successfully automate the entire deployment stack including ASP.NET, SQL Server, SSRS, SSIS, and PowerShell DSC.

When not spending time with my wife and two boys or playing around with home automation, I participate on an amatuer endurance race car team.
