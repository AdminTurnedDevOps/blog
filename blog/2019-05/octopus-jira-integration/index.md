We recently shipped our [Octopus Deploy plugin for Jira](https://marketplace.atlassian.com/apps/1220376/octopus-deploy-for-jira) and I thought I explore it a bit as it unlocks some really cool scenarios and benefits. 

Octopus is focused on automating DevOps and deployment processes. This enables us to focus on this single goal and build the best DevOps tool available  however it also means we ignore other areas of the software development process and CI/CD pipeline. That's why it's exciting for us to launch our 

Integrating Octopus and Jira unlocks three key scenarios: 

* **[See when features or bug fixes are deployed to Prod](#See-when-features-or-bug-fixes-are-deployed-to-Prod).** 'Done' means deployed to production and this is now visible directly in your Jira issues. See if your team has completed a new feature or fix and see if it's been deployed to production. 
* **[See the Jira issues included in Octopus releases](#See-the-Jira-issues-included-in-Octopus-Releases).** It's now possible to see what Jira issues (work items) are included in Octopus releases with links back to Jira for further details.
* **[Generate release notes automatically](#Generate-and-share-Release-Notes-automatically).** Octopus can now intelligently generate release notes visible directly your deployments to your environments like test and production. Share them with your team, management or executives via email, slack and more.

## See when features or bug fixes are deployed to Prod

> Done means deployed to production

If you've ever worked with development teams, you would have heard someone say it's 98% done and then it takes week for it to go live. This lead to teams saying work is only done when it's been deployed to production. It's now simple to see if a new feature or hotfix is marked done and also deployed to prod. You can click through to Octopus for further details.

This enables greater visibility and insight for your team, managers and executives in the tool they're most comfortable with.
