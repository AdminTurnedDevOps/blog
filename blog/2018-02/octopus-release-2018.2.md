Octopus 2018.2 brings a number of exciting new features including the [much requested step to deploy a release](https://octopusdeploy.uservoice.com/forums/170787-general/suggestions/9811932-allow-project-dependencies-so-deploying-one-proj), the ability to deploy AWS CloudFormation templates, delete existing CloudFormation stacks, and run scripts with the AWS CLI.

## AWS Support

This release introduces 3 new steps related to AWS.

The first allows custom scripts to be run against the AWS CLI. Octopus provides the AWS credentials and the AWS CLI itself, making it easy to interact with AWS resources as part of a deployment.

The two other steps allow you to deploy CloudFormation templates and delete existing CloudFormation stacks. Octopus takes care of the parameters and outputs, and allows you to deploy CloudFormation templates entered directly in the step or from an external package.

## Michael Richardson's new steps
