In the second episode of Ask Octopus, we cover some API centric questions and talk about Automatic Deployment Triggers. We've also launched a [new page](https://hello.octopus.com/ask-octopus) where you can view all questions and submit new ones.

Here are the questions with direct links to where they start in the video:

- [00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7W_TPzjZoJQ&t=25s) - My API key is used everywhere and I'm leaving the company, what do I do?
- [07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7W_TPzjZoJQ&t=475s) - Using the API, how can I get a project ID by name?
- [13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7W_TPzjZoJQ&t=787s) - How to scale infrastructure with deployment triggers in Octopus
