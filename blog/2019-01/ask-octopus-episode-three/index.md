We're releasing the third episode of Ask Octopus a little bit early this week. In this episode, we cover some variable run conditions, some tips for switching authentication providers, and how to find a deleted release. You can find previous episodes and submit questions on our [Ask Octopus](https://hello.octopus.com/ask-octopus) page.

Here are the questions with direct links to where they start in the video:

- [00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ftd8ga0yi6Q&t=33s) - How can I run a step only when a specific step fails?
- [06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ftd8ga0yi6Q&t=6m48s) - Tips and Tricks when switching Authentication Providers
- [13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ftd8ga0yi6Q&t=13m22s) - My release is missing? How can I find out what happened?
