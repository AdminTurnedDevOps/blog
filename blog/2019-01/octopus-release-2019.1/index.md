## Spaces

Octopus Deploy is proud to ship [Spaces](https://octopus.com/spaces). Our goal is to help teams focus on what matters by giving them their own space.

You can [download Octopus Server 2019.1](https://octopus.com/downloads) now!

## Give teams their own space

We have been working very hard and for a very long time to make all the necessary changes to Octopus Deploy and the permission system to be able to give teams their own space.

For more information about Spaces, have a look at our [Spaces blog series](https://octopus.com/blog/octopus-spaces-blog-series-kick-off)

## Breaking Changes

Using Spaces is entirely opt-in. We have done extensive work and testing to ensure the feature is as backwards compatible as possible.

In order to support Spaces and to deliver improvements to how you can [configure teams](https://octopus.com/blog/team-configuration-improvements) we made some breaking API changes. Before upgrading you should [review the full set here](https://octopus.com/downloads/compare?from=2018.12.1&to=2019.1.0).

## Integrations / Tentacle

Once you have updated to 2019.1 and want to start making use of the Spaces feature in your Octopus instance you will need to upgrade your integrations including [Tentacle](https://octopus.com/downloads).

## Upgrading

As usual [steps for upgrading Octopus Deploy](https://octopus.com/docs/administration/upgrading) apply. Please see the [release notes](https://octopus.com/downloads/compare?to=2019.1.0) for further information. Self-Hosted Octopus customers can [download](https://octopus.com/downloads/2019.1.0) the latest release now. For Octopus Cloud, you will start receiving the latest bits in about 2 weeks during their maintenance window.

That's it for this month. Feel free to leave us a comment and let us know what you think! Go forth and deploy!
