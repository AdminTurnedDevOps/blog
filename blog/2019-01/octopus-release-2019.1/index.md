## Give teams their own space

Octopus Deploy now has Spaces. We have been working very hard and for a very long time to make all the necessary changes to Octopus Deploy and the permission system to be able to give teams their own space.


## Breaking Changes

Spaces is entirely opt-in. We have done extensive work and testing to ensure the feature is as backwards compatible as possible. But this release does include some major breaking changes. Before upgrading you should [review the full set here](https://octopus.com/downloads/compare?from=2018.12.1&to=2019.1.0).

## Upgrading

As usual [steps for upgrading Octopus Deploy](https://octopus.com/docs/administration/upgrading) apply. Please see the [release notes](https://octopus.com/downloads/compare?to=2019.1.0) for further information. Self-Hosted Octopus customers can [download](https://octopus.com/downloads/2019.1.0) the latest release now. For Octopus Cloud, you will start receiving the latest bits next week during their maintenance window.

That's it for this month. Feel free to leave us a comment and let us know what you think! Go forth and deploy!
