## Spaces !!

Octopus Deploy is proud to ship Spaces. The team have been working very hard and for a very long time to make all the necessary changes to Octopus Deploy and the permission system to support the "hard walls" isolation that comes with Spaces.

## Breaking Changes

Spaces is entirely opt-in. We have done extensive work and testing to ensure the feature is as backwards compatible as possible. But this release does include some major breaking changes. Before upgrading you should review the full set here *TODO link to it*.

## Upgrading

As usual [steps for upgrading Octopus Deploy](https://octopus.com/docs/administration/upgrading) apply. Please see the [release notes](https://octopus.com/downloads/compare?to=2019.1.0) for further information. Self-Hosted Octopus customers can [download](https://octopus.com/downloads/2019.1.0) the latest release now. For Octopus Cloud, you will start receiving the latest bits next week during their maintenance window.

That's it for this month. Feel free to leave us a comment and let us know what you think! Go forth and deploy!
