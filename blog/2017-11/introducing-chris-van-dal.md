Hi!

My name is Chris van Dal and I have just joined Octopus as a Windows and Linux Systems Engineer. I have been working in this space for over 10 years and I am very excited about starting my new journey at Octopus.

I am passionate about automation, infrastructure as code, continuous integration, and continuous delivery.

In my spare time, if I'm not spending time with my family or friends, I like to dabble in .NET, React, and TypeScript. I am also a Los Angeles Dodgers and Sydney Blue Sox fanatic.
