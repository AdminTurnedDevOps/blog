Hi, my name is Shaun Marx and have recently joined Octopus as a developer.

I have been working as a developer using .NET for the past 10 years while having fun keeping up with
the javascript ecosystem. I have mainly worked on systems that deal with the safety
of people in electrical transmission where I have also gone through the pain of trying to automate everything without
a tool such as Octopus Deploy.

I am passionate about learning and constantly improving and I can't think of a better company for that to happen.

When I am not working on some side project or learning something new you can find me running after my twin kids. If there is still some time left in a day you can usually find me trying my hand at some woodworking.
