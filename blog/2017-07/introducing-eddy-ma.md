Hi! My name is Eddy, and I joined Octopus Deploy as a Developer in July 2017.

In my previous jobs I have been mainly working on .NET platform. The first system that i worked on was a finance system with ASP.NET website as the frontend and Windows Service running as the backend. One year later my manager asked me to look after the deployments and pointed me to a Wiki with 3 pages of instructions and I need to tick each one of them as i go. I felt happy as I took an important role but also stressful as the systems were dealing with money, it could not afford to go wrong. I guess this is not only my problem.

Lucky that i did not make mistake because i chose the conservative way e.g. only change the settings in the web/app.config if they were necessary, backup the config files with timestamp in the same directory and only deploy if i have to.

I started using Octopus Deploy couple years ago and i was extremely impressed, it solved all the deployment problems most developers have, make deployment process not that scary, hence we can deploy more often and gain feedback earlier.

I am excited as a member of Octopus Deploy, it means working with great people, awesome product and solving other people's deployment problems.

In my spare time I love learning technologies, doing open source projects, fishing and Go Karting.
