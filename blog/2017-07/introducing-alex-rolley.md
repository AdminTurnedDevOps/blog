Hi, I'm Alex and I have just joined the Octopus #teamawesome, aka the Octopus Support Team.

I've been professionally supporting people in IT for almost 16 years [oh hey [Windows XP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_XP)], starting as a lowly support person for a small IT retailer and working my way up to be a support team lead at [Sullivan Nicolaides Pathology](http://snp.com.au).

During that span of time I have first hand seen the affects of bad releases and release processes and I am very invested in supporting you so that it never happens again!

When I'm not providing you with quality support I can generally be found providing friends with their own IT support (and experimenting with VLAN routing) with coffee in hand. At night I will be found watching [anything](http://www.supercars.com/) [on](http://www.fiawec.com/) [four](https://www.imsa.com/) [wheels](https://www.formula1.com/) [that](http://www.indycar.com/) [races](http://europeanlemansseries.com/). My loving wife and 3 small girls put up with my flights of motorsport fancy and support me in my general nerdery/coffee addiction.
