Hi! I'm Tom and I have just joined Octopus Deploy as a Senior Software Developer.

Previously, I was working at Zap Technology where I was working on Business Intelligence software. Octopus Deploy was an important part of our toolset, and I have been following the company for some time now.

I love making software, and I love creating great experiences for users. I'm really excited to bring that passion to the Octopus team.

In my spare time, you might find me coding, hiking, mountain biking, reading, playing board games, or struggling to type with Dvorak.
