Hi, I'm Dean and I have just joined the Octopus team.

I've been developing software for quite a few years now, and have worked in a variety of industries including education, health care, insurance and defence.

I work with a range of technologies, and I particularly enjoy product development and building quality software that genuinely makes life easier for others. 

Although I live in Melbourne I am still a country lad at heart and love the great outdoors. I'm an avid DIYer and enjoy building/fixing all sorts of things.
