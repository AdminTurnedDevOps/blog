## Feature 1

## Feature 2

## Breaking changes

There are no breaking changes in this release, but it may be worth noting we have adjusted the SQL database schema upgrades as we discussed above.

`SQL Error 4060 - Cannot open database "OctopusDeploy" requested by the login. The login failed.`

If you see an error message like this after the installer completes, you can start the Octopus Server just like before and let it perform the schema upgrades.

## Upgrading

All of the usual [steps for upgrading Octopus Deploy](https://octopus.com/docs/administration/upgrading) apply. Please see the [release notes](https://octopus.com/downloads/compare?to=3.14.0) for further information.

## Wrap Up

Thatâ€™s it for this month. We hope you enjoy the latest features and our new release. Feel free to leave us a comment and let us know what you think!  Happy deployments!
