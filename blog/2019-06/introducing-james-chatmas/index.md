My name is James Chatmas, I'm from Portland, Maine, USA, and I joined Octopus Deploy in May 2019 as a Technical Account Manager.

Throughout my career, I have always worked in roles involving release management in some capacity; I enjoy streamlining and automating processes to make other peoples' lives easier. I've used Octopus Deploy to create multi-tenanted deployment processes for web applications, desktop applications, and services.  I believe that strong relationships with customers are key to improving deployments of software, and I look forward to the opportunity to work with customers to best support their deployment goals with using Octopus Deploy.

In my spare time, you'll find me keeping active with CrossFit or running, taking pictures of dogs or weddings, or volunteering with animal rescue organizations.
