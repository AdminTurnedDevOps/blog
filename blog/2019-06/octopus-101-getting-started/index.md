Last month we launched a new webinar series, "Octopus 101 - Getting Started." In this webinar, Derek and I introduced the core concepts of Octopus by setting up deployments for a sample application in a new Octopus server.

We'll be hosting this webinar monthly.  If you're getting started with Octopus or have some new team members that would benefit from the overview and Q&A, [register here](https://octopus.zoom.us/webinar/register/WN_5ZaCOiP5SXSUhSztPPuSgQ) and join us live.

We're planning more webinars on advanced topics. Up first, Derek is going to tackle [Turbo Charging Azure DevOps with Octopus Deploy](https://octopus.zoom.us/webinar/register/WN_93jsiLalSPCLfApxzfWNGA).  Is there a topic you'd like to see in a webinar? Let us know in the comments!

And if you haven't seen them yet, check out our [Ask Octopus series](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLAGskdGvlaw3-cd9rPiwhwfUo7kDGnOBh).

We hope to see you at one of our webinars. Until then, happy deployments!
