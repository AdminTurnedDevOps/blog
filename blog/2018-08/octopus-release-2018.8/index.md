## Release Tour

_To Be Added_

## Script Step Packages++

In 2018.8 the family of script steps (_Run a Script_, _Run an Azure PowerShell Script_, _Run an AWS CLI Script_) gain some new super-powers.   

We are making consuming packages from script steps much easier and more powerful.  Multiple package references can now be added, and each package can be optionally extracted.  Container images can also be referenced.  

We have a whole [post on these enhancements](https://octopus.com/blog/script-step-packages), so please have a read.

## Kubernetes Alpha



## Upgrading

As usual [steps for upgrading Octopus Deploy](https://octopus.com/docs/administration/upgrading) apply. Please see the [release notes](https://octopus.com/downloads/compare?to=2018.8.0) for further information.
