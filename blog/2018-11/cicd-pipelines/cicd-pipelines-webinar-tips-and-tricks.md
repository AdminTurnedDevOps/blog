In this webinar, youâ€™ll learn from Microsoft MVP, Jeffrey Palermo and Octopus Deploy Founder and CEO, Paul Stovell as they share tips and tricks to optimize your CI/CD pipeline.

Some of the questions covered include :
* How has deployment automation changed since you founded Octopus Deploy?
* Why have you made servicing Octopus Deploy a focus on Clear Measure?
* What are Workers, and how they fit into the steps of my deployment project?
* How often should you deploy? 5 times a day? 1 time per week? Or just the ability to deploy whenever you want/need to?
* We have a lot of teams using Octopus, but each team uses Octopus differently.  How can we encourage consistency between teams?
* When would I choose Octopus Deploy over Azure DevOps Services or TeamCity?
* Should we move our self-hosted Octopus server to Octopus Cloud?
* I have 100 deployment steps in my project.  Is that normal?
