In this webinar, you’ll learn from Microsoft MVP, Jeffrey Palermo and Octopus Deploy Founder and CEO, Paul Stovell as they share tips and tricks to optimize your CI/CD pipeline. 

Some of the questions covered include:
*  How often should you deploy? 5 times a day? 1 time per week? Or just the ability to deploy whenever you want/need to? (10:02)
* We have a lot of teams using Octopus, but each team uses Octopus differently. How can we encourage consistency between teams? (14:09)
* When should I chose Octopus Deploy over TeamCity or Azure DevOps Services? (21:00)
* Should we move our Self-Hosted Octopus to Octopus Cloud? (31:13)
* When a deployment fails, how do you configure a rollback? (33:14)
* I have 100 steps in my deployment project, is that normal? (41:48)
* What’s the best way to handle tons and tons of variables? (1:11:52)
